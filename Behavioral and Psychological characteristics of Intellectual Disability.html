<div>	<center><h1>Behavioral and Psychological characteristics of Intellectual Disability</h1></center></div>
<p >
		Individuals with <b>intellectual disability (ID)</b> are at heightened risk for developing behavior problems and mental disorder, a phenomenon known as <b>dual diagnosis</b>. 
		<br>This increased risk is well-documented in adulthood, and most researchers estimate that between 20% and 35% of adults with ID have psychiatric disorders. <br>
		Dual diagnosis presents particular challenges for individuals of ID and their caregivers, resulting in:
		<ul>
			<li>Family caregiving burden.</li>
			<li>Increasing the likelihood of being placed out of the home in residential treatment settings.</li>
			<li>Putting individuals at greater risk for social isolation. </li>
			<li>Putting individuals at greater risk for social isolation. </li>
			<li>Poor academic and vocational outcomes.</li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Behavioral Characteristics</h2>
			<b><ul>
				<li>Impulse Control</li>
				<li>Frustration Tolerance</li>
				<li>Aggression/ Aggressive Behavior</li>
				<li>Adaptive Behavior</li>
			</ul>
			</b>
			Most intellectually disabled children are aware that they are not as intellectually adept as their peers. This knowledge can lead to:
			<ul>
				<li>Self-esteem issues, as emotional and behavioral problems.</li>
				<li>Younger children may be withdrawn or anxious, or they may exhibit angry or attention-seeking outbursts.</li>
				<li>Teenagers may exhibit signs of depression. These problems, if not treated, can impede a child’s progress.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>IMPULSE CONTROL</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>One problem with intellectual disability is impulse   control. </li>
				<li>People with ID have trouble in connecting cause and effect. </li>
				<li>This in turn causes problems with impulse control.</li>
			</ul>
		<p><b>For instance</b>, suppose a child (child not having ID issue) sees yummy hot cookies coming out of the oven. The child wants to grab one immediately, if not controlled, this impulse will cause a nasty burn. <br>
		They form a connection b/w the hot cookie (cause) and the burn (effect). They learn to control the impulse to grab a cookies right out of the oven.<br>
		However, this is not so easily learned by people with ID. This poor impulse control leads to many unpleasant consequences.</p>
		</div>
	<h3>Frustration Tolerance</h3>
	<div>
	A related problem to impulse control is poor frustration tolerance. 
	<br>
	When an impulse is inhibited, it requires the ability to tolerate a bit of frustration. <br>
	This ability is called <b>frustration tolerance.</b><br>
	<img src="frustration.png" width="300" height="300" alt="frustration tolerance"><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Frustration tolerance is an important developmental skill. </li>
		<li>It allows people to comfortably endure the small frustrations of everyday life. </li>
		<li>Frustration Tolerance also enables people to build confidence. </li>
		<li>People with ID respond to frustration in different ways: 
			<ul>
			<li>Impulsive, stubborn, and aggressive manner. </li>
			<li>Passivity, withdrawal, and compliance.</li>
			<li>Cause aggression toward caregivers and lead to self-injurious behavior.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
<h3>Aggressive behavior</h3>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Aggressive behavior not only has negative consequences for the environment of the person but also for the aggressor.</li>
		<li>Physical injury, interference with social activities of aggressive behavior for the aggressor.</li>
	</ul>

<img src="aggression.png" width="300" height="300" alt="aggression">
<ul>
	<li>Staff and family members can experience negative emotions, stress, physical injuries and fear of assault or burn out.</li>
	<li>Aggressive behavior in persons with ID, often display multiple forms of aggressive behavior at the same time (e.g., physical, verbal and/ or auto-aggressive behavior). </li>
	<li>People with mild ID or borderline intellectual functioning are at a clearly increased risk of developing mental health problems.</li>
	<li>Irritability and aggression at high rates.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOUR</h3>
<div>
	<b>Definition</b><br>
	“Adaptive behavior refers to the skills that people need to function independently at home, at school and in the community.”<br>
		Children with ID have substantial deficits in adaptive behavior. These limitations can take many forms and tend to occur across domains of functioning. 
		<ul>
			<li>Limitation in self-care and daily living skills and social relationships are common characteristics of individuals with ID.</li>
			<li><b>Self-Care and Daily Living Skills:</b> Most individuals with ID who required extensive supports must learn basic self-care skills, such as dressing, eating and hygiene.</li>
			<li><b>Social relationships:</b> Making and sustaining friendships and personal relationships presents a significant challenges for many children with ID. Poor communication skills, inability to recognize the emotional state of others, can leave to social isolation.
			</li>
		</ul>
</div>
<h3>Psychological Characteristics</h3>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Psychopathology in children with ID may be associated with certain aspects of self-image and personality. </li>
		<li>Unlike, their developing counter-parts, children with ID generally show more global and less of themselves.</li>
		<li>These views may set the stage for more negative or unrealistic appraisals of the self over time, which may be exacerbated by repeated exposures to failure.</li>
		<li>Failure then contributes to feelings of uncertainty and “learned helplessness”, which in turn linked to depression and other problems.</li>
		<li>
			Self-image and Personality 
			<ul>
				<li>show more global</li>
   				<li>less of themselves.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			 Unrealistic Appraisals of  Self Over Time 
			<ul>
				<li>exacerbated by repeated exposures to failure.</li>

		</li>
		<li>
			Failure
			<ul>
				<li>uncertainty and “learned helplessness”</li>
   				<li>depression and other problems.</li>

</div>
<h3>Psychological Characteristics</h3>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Personality Styles</li>
		<li>Low Self-Esteem</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<h4>Personality Styles</h4>
<div>
	Personality styles of ID children tied to psychopathology. 
	<ul>
		<li>An outer-directed orientation whereby children look to others (instead of themselves) for solutions to difficult problems.</li>
		<li>Aberrant social styles such as being either too wary or too disinhibited with others.</li>
		<li>Low expectancy or enjoyment of success. </li>
	</ul>
</div>
<h4>Low Self-Esteem	</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Self-esteem naturally develops as children learn to solve problems. The ability to solve problems builds self-confidence.</li>
		<li>Skillful problem solving requires sustained attention and persistence in the face of difficulty. These abilities are limited in persons with intellectual disability.</li>
		<li>Thus, a low self-esteem may develop.</li>
		<li>Psychiatric disorders related to low self-esteem, such as depression, may accompany intellectual disabilities.</li>
		<li>However, many people with ID are quite happy and content. They don’t exhibit problematic behavior.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<h3>Academic Characteristics</h3>
<div>
	Intellectual disability can be defined as a significantly reduced ability to: 
	<ul>
		<li>Understand new or complex information.</li>
		<li>Learn new skills.  </li>
		<li>To cope independently including social functioning.
		</li>
		<li>There are number of characteristics that may have a significant impact on an individual’s learning, including:
			<ul>
				<li>Difficulty understanding new information</li>
				<li>Difficulties comprehending abstract concepts</li>
				<li>Difficulties with communication and social skills</li>
				<li>Difficulty in sequential processing of information</li>
				<li>Slow cognitive processing time.</li>
			</ul>
